# libft
My own implementation of the standard C library, from scratch, for my use.

What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at 42 that requieres us to re-create some standard C library functions for future projects, and have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At 42 we are not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this libary with our own functions as we go farther in the program.
