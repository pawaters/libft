# libft
My own implementation of the standard C library, from scratch, for my use.

### What is libft?

Libft is an individual project at Hive Helsinki that requieres us to re-create some standard C library functions for future projects, and have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At Hive Helsinki we are not allowed to use some standard libraries on our C projects, so we have to keep growing this libary with our own functions as we go farther in the program.

### What's in it?

60 functions. 
In this library, we added all the basic helper functions we will use in a C program to build more complex algos.
Here are the 4 main types of functions in this library:
- string manipulation 
- identificators/validators (is it a character? a number?)
- memory manipulation 
- linked-lists manipulation.
